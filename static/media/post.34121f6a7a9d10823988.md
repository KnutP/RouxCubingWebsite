 ### Rules: 
 1. Do your best to comply with as many WCA regs as you can (inspection/penalties/etc.), but we don't mind if you solve using the keyboard. 
 2. Be honest with your times, we run on a trust basis, let's make this fun and fair for everyone. 
 3. The only methods allowed for 3x3, OH and FMC are Roux and its variants (ZBroux, Pinky Pie). 
 4. FMC is counted in STM, and is meant as efficiency practice. Techniques that can't be done linearly (like NISS and insertions) cannot be used in FMC. 
 5. Only Roux based methods are allowed on 4x4 (Rouxduction, Meyer, Stadler). 
 6. If you're not sure whether a method/technique is allowed or not, ask in the comments. 
 7. The comp runs until Sunday 5pm Eastern time (more or less). Enter your times using the forms links below.
